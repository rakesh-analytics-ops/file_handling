📂 File Handling in Python

This project is created to practice real-world file handling in Python.
The main goal is to understand how data is loaded, checked, and cleaned from files before doing any analysis.

Instead of jumping directly into EDA or machine learning, this project focuses on the first and most important step — working with raw files.

📌 Why I did this project

In real projects, data rarely comes clean.
Most of the time, it comes as CSV or Excel files with missing values, wrong formats, or inconsistent columns.

I did this project to:

get comfortable working with files

understand common file-related issues

practice cleaning data step by step

📂 What kind of data is used

I used a loan default–type dataset stored in:

CSV files

Excel files

This helped me practice reading data from different file formats and handling common problems while loading them.

🧠 What I worked on in this project

In this project, I practiced:

reading CSV and Excel files using Python

checking file structure and column names

handling missing or incorrect values

validating data types

preparing clean data for further analysis

The focus was more on process and understanding, not just writing code.

🛠️ Tools Used

Python

Pandas

CSV & Excel files

Jupyter Notebook

✅ What I learned

How file handling works in real projects

Why data validation is important before analysis

Common issues that appear while loading files

How small file errors can affect later analysis

⚠️ Limitations

Dataset is used only for learning

No advanced modeling or visualization is included

🔮 What I plan to do next

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the cleaned data

Use the cleaned dataset for machine learning practice

Automate basic data validation checks
